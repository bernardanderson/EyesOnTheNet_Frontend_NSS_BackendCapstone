## NSS Backend Capstone Part-2: "EyesOnTheNet Frontend Component"
#### (See the <a href="https://github.com/bernardanderson/EyesOnTheNet_Backend_NSS_BackendCapstone">"Part 1"</a> for the Backend Web API)
 

### Specs:
> The idea behind this project was to build an application to allow secure access to webcameras which may have no or insecure authentication methods. A number of older webcameras are "out-in-the-wild" that have Authentication methods that are known to be easily hackable.  With 'EyesOnTheNet' a user can access webcameras via this more secure Backend Web API interface in order to still be able to access antiquated webcameras without having to put the actual webcameras on the public internet. This application was extended to allow for public webcamera access as well as displaying the physical location of the user entered camera via GoogleMaps. 
> This is the "Part 2" Frontend portion of the project. See <a href="https://github.com/bernardanderson/EyesOnTheNet_Backend_NSS_BackendCapstone">"Part 1"</a> for the Backend Web API portion.
